# "1 - 2 Not there yet
# I	The code does not compile and is inefficient when it's running in an expert's perspective
# II The code is hard to understand and take more than 15 minutes to read by an expert
# III The search engine has not extra functions, but only has typing the stock's name to get information

# "3 - 4 Almost there
# I	The code compiles, but the code is poorly written and confusing to read and doesn't do what it is intended to do in an expert's perspective.
# II The code is still hard to understand and take more than 10 minutes to read by an expert
# III The search engine has limited extra functions, it has by typing the stock's name and change rate to get information
# IV 20 to 30 errors or less than 20 errors in running the code.

# "5 - 6
# Got it(meets)
# I	The code compiles successfully and does what is intended to do,  but it runs inefficiently and contains unnecessary processing in an expert's perspective.
# II The code is getting easy to understand and take more than 5 minutes to read by an expert
# III The search engine has extra basic functions, it has by typing the stock's name, change rate and current price to get information.
# IV 10 to 20 errors or less than 10 errors in running the code.

# "7 - 8
# Wow(succeeds)
# I	Code compiles successfully. The code does what it is intended to do, and is clearly written, also comments are included in the code to explain what it does. Variable and methods are named to indicate what function they perform.  Also it runs efficiently and contains no unnecessary processing in an expert's perspective.
# II The code is easy to understand and take less than 5 minutes to read by an expert
# III The search engine has extra advanced functions, it has by typing the stock's name, change rate, current price and turnover rate to get information.
# IV 1 or 4 errors or completely 0 errors in running the code.
